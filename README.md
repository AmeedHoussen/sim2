# sim2 â€“ Advanced Logic Simulation

A follow-up project to `sim1`, this simulation extends the capabilities of a digital logic circuit by introducing new components and signal control logic.

## Highlights

- Extended gate logic
- Input waveform generation
- Timing control for signal transitions

## Getting Started

1. Load all `.sv` files into your simulation environment
2. Compile and run the testbench
3. Analyze waveform behavior in GUI

## Example Output

Simulated signal behavior for complex circuit conditions
